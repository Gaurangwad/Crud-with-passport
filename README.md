# Crud-with-passport
This project is a Node.js web application that demonstrates CRUD operations with user authentication using Passport.js. It allows users to register, log in, and access a protected dashboard. The application uses MongoDB for data storage and EJS for rendering views. Itâ€™s a simple yet functional example of building secure, database-driven web apps.
